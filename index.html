    <p>Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. 
      The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. 
      Allan Alcorn created Pong as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. 
      Pong was the first commercially successful video game.
      Atari is both the developer and publisher of this game in its earliest stages.
      Soon after its release, several companies began producing games that copied its gameplay, and eventually released new types of games.
      As a result, Atari encouraged its staff to produce more innovative games. 
      The company released several sequels which built upon the original's gameplay by adding new features.
      Pong is part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. due to its cultural impact.
